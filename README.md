A Blender Add-on for streamlining the process of baking and exporting materials to PBR textures in a few clicks.

â€»This add-on is still being maintained, I will be adding more features whenever I am free or in need of some specific functionalities! :)

## Version Compatibility
This addon works for blender version 4.4.0 and should be backward compatible. 
However, I haven't checked other for other versions yet since this add-on was initially created for personal use only.

## Demos

## Known Issues 
- Export format doesn't conform fully to the specified format.
- The nodes going into different output cannot be the same otherwise there will be issues when rewrangling internally. Right now consider making 

## Notes



In case anyone wants to go through the code. Most files are documented with docstrings, I did try to be as detailed as possible but there are still some disrepancy in conventions between some files so please do we aware of that.

### Future plans (No promises)
- Normals swizzle based on engine
- High to Low-poly baking
- Bake Queue and presets
- Channel Packing
